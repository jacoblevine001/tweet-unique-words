# tweet-unique-words


This is a small java program that creates a count of unique words from a series of tweet data

  * It parses the csv which contains information such as username and time and date posted.
  * The program then uses a simple hashtable to store unique words (keys) and their count (value).

This was designed to look at a set of tweets from supposed russian  troll twitter accounts.

Some R data visualizations to come.
